git init - create new repository
(master x [in fish, after prompt] - x = dirty file/not committed)
do not create repo in home dir - if you do by accident, get rid of it

only use git init once per project


git status - gives status report showing status of repo
"bread and butter"


Basic Git Workflow:
unix_notes --> Add/Staging(trying it out) --> commit(snapshot)--> unix_notes
